## Overview
Can you manage a logistics network across the globe and get products from origin to destination? Out perform your
friends and move more cargo!  
 * Familiar mechanics: Auction, Worker Placement.
 * A different game each time with changing trucks and orders.

## Rules
This is a _Euro_ style game. The focus is on decision making and economic choices. These tend to be a little complicated
but a **ton** of fun. Our game takes place over ten turns, and each turn can be broken into six phases.

The game is played for a total of twelve rounds with six phases.

### The Turn Phases
 1. Determine Play Order
 2. Place Workers
 3. Take Orders
 4. Make Deliveries
 5. Purchase Trucks
 6. Resupply
 
#### Determine Play Order
 Play order is determined by the amount of contracts completed for each player. The player with the most completed contracts
in descending order. Players each place their position token on the _Play Order_  track to represent their spot in
the play queue.

#### Place Workers
**This phase is played in REVERSE play order.**  
 The _Contract Market_, _Traffic Control_ and _Truck Market_ all have spaces in which a worker can be placed. These spaces are
filled from left to right and will be acted on in the same order. Therefor, it is advantageous to place your worker in
one of these areas before your opponents in order to have the most options available.  
 Starting with the player last in turn order each player will place one worker on any of the open worker spaces on the
board. A player may choose to place more than one of their workers in any queue, but may also place one at a time.
 In games with fewer than five players, only those spots marked with the correct player number symbol can be used.
 
#### Take Orders
 Starting with the player whose color worker is on the left of the _Contract Market_ queue each player in turn will
select one of the available contracts. A player may choose any of the available contracts. If a player placed two workers
in this market they may pick one contract per worker but only in the order that workers were placed. _Contracts_ are
placed faced up in front of the player.

#### Make Deliveries
 Starting with the player whose color worker is in the left of the _Traffic Control_ queue each player may move one vehicle
a single length of its route. This length is defined as moving from the current _Rest Stop_ or _City_ to the next along
the route. A player may move any one of his or her vehicles in this fashion for each worker in the queue. 
 If this causes a vehicle to reach the destination for a contract the player may then immediately flip the _Contract_
face-down to indicate its completion and take the reward.

#### Purchase Trucks
 Starting with the player whose color worker in the left of the _Truck Market_ queue each player may choose to purchase
a vehicle for each worker they placed in this queue. A player may purchase one vehicle for each worker in the queue, one
at a time.

#### Resupply
 In this phase all players should have collected their workers back into their hand. The _Contract Market_ should be 
replenished by drawing new _Contracts_ from the deck.
 Move the _Turn Marker_ on the _Turn Track_.

## Background
While visiting [PAX South](http://south.paxsite.com/) authors Dave and Marshall sat in a panel on how to break into the tabletop gaming 
industry. One of the major points was _"Think about how you're going ship!"_ This struck a chord and they thought,
_"THAT would make a good game. Let's do it!"_
